		<h1>It's hard to be a man</h1>
        <p>Considering the bargain it demands<br />
Pretend to be a sergeant in command<br />
But even when you’ve started with a plan<br />
Things look really different when the cards are in your hand<br />
Even fighting for our rights, we don’t see as many pardons from the stands<br />
Nobody goes too far to understand<br />
The feelings from the heart within are banned<br />
Discarded just like garbage in a can<br />
It's like trying to plant a garden in the sand<br />
Because every time we fight without a win<br />
We know we need to get up, dust off and strive for it again<br />
With the stone faced pride of being men<br />
But at times we need to vent cuz we’re too damned tired to pretend<br />
It really does hurt but we try to keep it in<br />
So it's bottled up inside of us like gin<br />
A poison that is likely to ascend<br />
Higher up it rises ‘til it renders us victims of anxiety and then<br />
Emotions get the best of us in spite of our defense<br />
Frustrations got us pacing like a lion in its den<br />
But there s no time for crying to commence<br />
To survive and to contend<br />
We must fight until our life is at its end<br />
So, pain is right where it begins<br />
For fear of loss is enticing us to sin</p>
<h3>The line between playing to win and sin is thin</h3>
<h3>Sin all depends on what you're believing in</h3>
