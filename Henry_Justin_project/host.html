            <p>Adaptability is one of my favorite assets. Fitting into multiple groups allows me to learn a lot and pick up on different ways to communicate. Whether for an audience of music fans, tech geeks, art enthusiasts, political campaigners, children, etc., I can find a way to relate to convey whatever moods and information situations require.</p>
